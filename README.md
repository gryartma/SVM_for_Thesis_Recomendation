# 🎓 Thesis: Final Project Topic Recommendation System using SVM & SMOTE

This repository contains the final thesis report of my undergraduate project at Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta.

## 📌 Project Summary
In this study, I developed a classification model using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** combined with **SMOTE** to recommend appropriate thesis topics for students based on their academic history.

## 📄 Contents
- `Thesis_Report_SVM_Recommender.pdf`: Full documentation of the research, methodology, and results.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Data preprocessing and transformation
- Imbalanced data handling using SMOTE
- SVM for multi-class classification
- Cross-validation and performance metrics

## 🏁 Results
- Achieved **90.74% accuracy** using SVM + SMOTE + Shuffled Sampling
- Demonstrated improved model performance on balanced datasets
